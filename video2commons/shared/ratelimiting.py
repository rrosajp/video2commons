    This context manager wraps yt-dlp's YoutubeDL class and automatically
    prevents multiple workers from downloading videos and metadata
    simultaneously based on the URL. This effectively reduces the risk of us
    being blocked by heavily rate-limited sites like YouTube.

    In addition to the existing YoutubeDL parameters, this context manager also
    requires that a Redis connection, source, and URL be provided. The source
    is the name of the app requesting a lock and is incorporated into the
    lock's key name. This allows a different lock to be used for the frontend
    than the backend workers.

    The URL is needed to allow different groups of sites to be ratelimited
    separately (or not at all). Currently, only YouTube is ratelimited.

    timeout controls how long the lock exists in Redis before auto-expiring.
    blocking_timeout controls how long to wait for the lock before giving up.
